Certain concepts we covered were totally foreign to me, especially those corresponding to older paradigms and languages. Fortran, for example, did not originally support recursion because all variables were allocated statically. For that matter, programming with no dynamic data (no heap) was at times awkward-and at other times extremely elegant, as was the case with a number of Prolog programs I wrote. (Indeed, the declarative programming paradigm in general was unfamiliar.) Never had it occurred to me that some programming languages did not (and still do not) support exception handling. I also did not previously have any understanding of how object-oriented programming is implemented in C++, so learning about virtual tables and pointers was especially interesting. In fact, we had to translate a class-based Java program into C-and I will never again take for granted all the work that takes place when I call new. I will also probably go to great pains to never have to write a malloc statement again.
